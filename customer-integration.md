1. Internal Support Agents: Supabase Auth
Interactive Login

Agents open a browser and go to your Amplify-hosted app (e.g. https://tenantX.yourcrm.com).
They click “Login” and authenticate with Supabase Auth (email/password, magic link, SSO, etc.).
Supabase Auth Session

Upon successful login, Supabase returns a JWT or session token.
Your front end uses that token in subsequent requests to your Amplify API routes.
Row-Level Security (RLS) in Supabase ensures they can only access data for their tenant and according to their role (admin, agent, etc.).
Granular Permissions

You can define roles in profiles.role (admin, agent, etc.) and apply RLS policies to enforce what each role can do.
This flow is typical for human users who need a UI to manage tickets, respond to customers, etc.

2. External Integrations: API Key or Service Account
For your customers (or their other systems) that need to programmatically create tickets, fetch statuses, or push data into your CRM without a human logging in:

2.1 Issue an API Key or “Service Account”
Generate an API key within your CRM’s admin panel (or automatically during tenant creation).
Assign that key to a special “service account” user that belongs to the tenant, possibly stored in the profiles table with a role = 'service'.
Provide the API key to the customer’s dev team so they can integrate their existing apps or websites.
2.2 API Usage with the Key
When calling your Amplify-based REST API:

Option A: Pass the API key as a Bearer token, e.g.
makefile
Copy
Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>
Option B: Exchange the API key for a short-lived JWT
If you want an OAuth-like flow, create a POST /token endpoint that verifies the API key, then returns a 15-60 minute JWT embedding the tenant ID and role. The customer’s app uses that JWT in subsequent calls.
In either case, your Amplify function checks if the API key (or the derived JWT) is valid and, if so, proceeds to query Supabase. The function can set tenant_id in the database context or rely on RLS policies matching the user’s tenant_id.

2.3 RLS Handling
If you’re using RLS, you’d do something like:

Service Account row in profiles has tenant_id = X and role = 'service'.
The token (or the service account’s metadata) includes those fields.
A typical RLS policy:
sql
Copy
CREATE POLICY "Allow service accounts to manipulate tickets"
ON tickets
FOR ALL
USING (tenant_id = auth.jwt()->>'tenant_id');
When the request hits Supabase, it sees the tenant_id from the token, so it only allows CRUD operations for that tenant’s data.
3. Why Not Use Supabase Auth for M2M?
Technically, you can use Supabase Auth for machine-to-machine if you want, but it’s a bit heavier:

You’d need to create a “user” for the machine and store credentials.
Machines typically shouldn’t manage email/password or magic links.
“Service account” or “API key” patterns are simpler and more standard for background scripts, CRON jobs, or external systems that don’t have a user interface.
4. Putting It All Together
Internal Staff:

Logs into your app with Supabase Auth.
A React front end uses the stored JWT for requests.
RLS ensures correct data access.
External Integrations:

Use a service account with an API key.
Calls your Amplify endpoints with Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY> or a short-lived JWT.
The Lambda function verifies the key (or JWT), sets the tenant_id, and performs the requested action in Supabase.
This division aligns with best practices: real people sign in with user credentials, while automated systems use service accounts or API keys. Both methods feed into the same Supabase schema with RLS controlling data access.
